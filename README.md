# Wifi_Hotspot_Finder
Creators: Phuoc Nguyen & Joshua Moratalla
A project done at QUT for the unit CAB230-Web Computing. 
The website is intended to provide locations of WiFi hotspots around Brisbane.


The assignment tasked us with a file that contained various locations of hotspots 
around brisbane and it was our job to implement a website that showed a listing of those hotspots,
a search function that showed the a list of hotspots matching the input value, a display of hotspot via google maps html
and other minor features.

In addition to the website, there was a database the held the information, pictures and ratings of the hotspots.
